                    <li> Utilized Microsoft Excel to prepare various reports, including daily and weekly sales, as well as monthly operations report.</li>

                    <li>Analyzed insurance documents provided by external business partners to identify the main benefits, provide comparison between different insurance plans, and calculated the premium for different age groups to be used as part of sales material.</li>

                  <p>With the aggravation of aging population and shortage of medical human resources,
                    health care for the elderly has become an increasingly profound problem. According
                    to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, by the end of 2019
                    elderly aged 60 or above make up around 18.1% of the total Chinese population. This 
                    opens up a new market targeting the elderly population.
                   <br>
                  
                    With the limited time given, we constructed a robot to take care of the elderly. The 
                    main functions of our product are: human-computer interactive interface, emergency
                    call function, automatic following system, medicine reminder, and deformable chair. 
                    In this project, my role was to develop the emergency call function. I worked remotely
                    with my team in Shanghai. Overall in this project I:<br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Developed an emergency call system which enables users to make emergency call within 5 seconds using a physical
                      button that is connected to an Android app via bluetooth connection.</li>
                      <li>
                        Managed the full life cycle of the project: gathering requirements from the sponsor, concept generation and evaluation,
                      product design, tracking progress against project timeline using Gantt chart, etc.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Used QFD House of Quality and weighted decision matrix to evaluate the available solutions to be implemented.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Performed competitive analysis to ensure product meets industry standard and identify possible unique value
                        proposition.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Performed QA testing on the deliverable product.

                    <p>Community detection has received a great interest as it can be used to reveal useful information regarding a network. 
                    For instance, in social networks, it can reveal group of individuals with mutual interests. There are numerous algorithms
                    that have been proposed to perform community detection within networks with varying performance. However, the performance of
                    these algorithms deteriorate as the structure of networks become more complex and the fraction of the neighbor of nodes belonging
                    to different communities than that of the benchmarking node increases. Thus, choosing the proper algorithm to give a reliable community
                    detection result is a tricky matter. In this paper, we explored several community detection algorithms and used the central node based link prediction(CLPE) method to detect
                    communities within Friendster.<br>

                    Multiple-linear regression plays a significant role in our life. For instance, the overlay error in photolitog- raphy can be describes using a multiple-linear regression model. In this project, we try to analyze various models using method of multiple-linear regression tool and tries to improve the base model. Then we try to use pytorch, an open source package for machine learning, to implement a neural network for fitting the data.

                    An RPN calculator is one in which the operators appear after their respective operands, rather than between them. So, instead of computing the following: (2 + 3) * 5, an RPN calculator would compute this equivalent expressionas 2 3 + 5 *. To print result, enter "p". Each input are pushed to the top of the stacks, enter "d" to duplicate the item at the top of the stack. To negate the item at the top of the stack, enter "n". To clear the stack, enter "c". To print all items on the stack, enter "a". To quit the program, enter "q".
