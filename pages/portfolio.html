                  <p>With the aggravation of aging population and shortage of medical human resources,
                    health care for the elderly has become an increasingly profound problem. According
                    to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, by the end of 2019
                    elderly aged 60 or above make up around 18.1% of the total Chinese population. This 
                    opens up a new market targeting the elderly population.
                   <br>
                  
                    With the limited time given, we constructed a robot to take care of the elderly. The 
                    main functions of our product are: human-computer interactive interface, emergency
                    call function, automatic following system, medicine reminder, and deformable chair. 
                    In this project, my role was to develop the emergency call function. I worked remotely
                    with my team in Shanghai. Overall in this project I:<br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Developed an emergency call system which enables users to make emergency call within 5 seconds using a physical
                      button that is connected to an Android app via bluetooth connection.</li>
                      <li>
                        Managed the full life cycle of the project: gathering requirements from the sponsor, concept generation and evaluation,
                      product design, tracking progress against project timeline using Gantt chart, etc.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Used QFD House of Quality and weighted decision matrix to evaluate the available solutions to be implemented.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Performed competitive analysis to ensure product meets industry standard and identify possible unique value
                        proposition.

                      <li>
                        Performed QA testing on the deliverable product.

                    <p>Community detection has received a great interest as it can be used to reveal useful information regarding a network. 
                    For instance, in social networks, it can reveal group of individuals with mutual interests. There are numerous algorithms
                    that have been proposed to perform community detection within networks with varying performance. However, the performance of
                    these algorithms deteriorate as the structure of networks become more complex and the fraction of the neighbor of nodes belonging
                    to different communities than that of the benchmarking node increases. Thus, choosing the proper algorithm to give a reliable community
                    detection result is a tricky matter. In this paper, we explored several community detection algorithms and implemented the central node based link prediction(CLPE) method in Python to detect
                    communities within Friendster.<br>

                    Multiple-linear regression plays a significant role in our life. For instance, the overlay error in photolitography can be describes using a multiplelinear regression model. In this project, we try to analyze various models using method of multiple-linear regression tool and tries to improve the base model. Then we try to use pytorch, an open source package for machine learning, to implement a neural network for fitting the data.

                    The MIPS architecture are widely used in current systems. Verilog hardware description language (HDL) is a general-purpose programming language optimized for electronic circuit design. In this project, we modeled and simulated both the single cycle and pipelined implementation of MIPS computer with a 32x32-bit register file in Verilog HDL to support a subset of MIPS instruction set. We also synthesized it  using Xilinx synthesis tool to implement the pipelined processor in the Xilinx FPGA board.

                    An RPN calculator is one in which the operators appear after their respective operands, rather than between them. So, instead of computing the following: (2 + 3) * 5, an RPN calculator would compute this equivalent expressionas 2 3 + 5 *. To print result, enter "p". Each input are pushed to the top of the stacks, enter "d" to duplicate the item at the top of the stack. To negate the item at the top of the stack, enter "n". To clear the stack, enter "c". To print all items on the stack, enter "a". To quit the program, enter "q".

After this course, I was able to understand the best practices in using SQL clauses and operators to manipulate and analyze data such as by performing JOINs, substrings, etc.<br>

                    This is the first course in Advanced Business Analytics specialization. This course was designed to expose learners to the data analytics practices executed in the business world. In this course, we explored key areas such as the analytical process, how data is created, stored, accessed, and how the organization works with data and creates the environment in which analytics can flourish. It equipped me with the understanding of data analytics in business context such as how to choose the proper analytical tools, Cloud technologies and ideas like federation, virtualization, Data Governance, Data Privacy, Data Quality, etc. <br>

                    This is the second course in Advanced Business Analytics specialization. This course was designed to expose learners to some of the most widely used predictive modeling techniques and their core principles. It teaches learners how to carry out exploratory data analysis to gain insights and prepare data for predictive modeling. This course equipped me with the ability to summarize and visualize datasets using plots and to use XLMiner for predictive modeling. <br>

                    This is the third course in Advanced Business Analytics specialization. This course was designed to teach learners to create models for decision making and prescriptive analytic models such as using cluster analysis for data reduction and using Monte Carlo simulation to help model uncertainty. In addition, we learnt how to perform optimization to identify and prescribe the best option and solutions to business problems. <br>
